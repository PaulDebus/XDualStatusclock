# XDualStatusclock
## Dual Clock module for Xposed Framework
This is a module I made during a semester abroad to show the time at home in my status bar.
It supports manual daylight saving time and timezone selection for the second clock and user selectable seperator character.

TODO:
Add support for Android 5.x

Feel free to copy and use the Code however you want. This is how I made the module by copying the example module.
